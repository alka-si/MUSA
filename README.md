Description:
A website where you can play and read lyrics of any song of your choice. It simulates
the experience of being at a concert Anywhere, Anytime-For Free.
At our main page, we provide a login/register form where users have to “PLUG IN”
their information to begin listening to their favourite songs.
As soon as they step inside the website, the homepage offers them with a “SONG OF
THE DAY”. We also have a carousel slider of our “FEATURED ARTISTS” on the
homepage.
A navigation bar that spans the entire website, consists of the logo, Home, Top
Charts and Artists through which you can reach the Homepage, Top Charts and
Artist’s page respectively. It also has a SEARCH MODAL, made using Data-lists,
through which we can search for different Artists in the website.
Our customised Audio Player, consists of a:
- Play/Pause button
- Next/Previous Song button
- Replay button
- Volume button.
We also have a Lyric button, where users can view lyrics of the song they are
listening to.
Our Artists page consists of 16 artists from all genres of music. When clicked, it
goes to its respective Artist’s webpage.
Our Top Charts consists of three top charts, namely, “Pop”, “Top 10” and “Country”.
